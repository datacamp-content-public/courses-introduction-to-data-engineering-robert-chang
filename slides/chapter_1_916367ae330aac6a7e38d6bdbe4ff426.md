Have you heard of Abraham Maslow's famous Hierarchy of Needs? In this theory, he laid out the progression of human needs, and argued that in order for the motivation for the next level to occur, the previous level of needs must be satisfied first before moving on to the next.

In 2017, Monica Rogati, an early LinkedIn data scientist, coined the term "The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs", where she argued that analytics capabilities are built layers upon layers, and just like Maslow's theory, one cannot move to the next stage of analytics until the foundation has been built. 

So what are the layers? The triangle chart below shows you the steps a typical company needs to go through to transform itself from a great company to a great data-driven company. 

First, at the bottommost layer, we need to start by building the infrastructure to collect data, such as logging and instrumentation. We will discuss the concept of instrumentation in details in later exercise, but think of it as a mechanism to understand how user interacts with the product (e.g. impression, clicks, page bounce, and more).

Once the raw data is stored, we need to move and and store these raw data in a secure place so we can use them in the future. In later chapter, we will talked about some of the most popular cloud service providers to explain how data is stored in modern data data-driven companies.

Going to the next level, we need to transform and clean the raw data in order to make them more usable. In later chapter, we will discuss the concept of ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load), which is a core concept for building a data warehouse.

With all this hard work, we can then finally start doing higher-valued work such as analytics, metrics tracking, and building dashboards. Beyond that, mature data-driven companies also use the same data to build experimentation platform to perform A/B test, or use them to construct training data for Machine Learning Model.

Unfortunately, in most of the news article out there nowadays, there is a strong emphasis on work that is happening in the top of the pyramid, rather than all the other foundational work that are less glamorous. However, it is important to have this mental model in mind. Without the foundation, analytics is not possible.
